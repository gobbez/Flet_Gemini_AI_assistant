# ü§ñ My Personal AI Assistant

My personal AI assistant: 
A local **Flet** web app powered by **Google Gemini** for intelligent conversations 
and direct **bash command execution**.  

It can answer and execute commands in succession until your task is completed.

## üåü Overview

This project is an **AI assistant designed for personal use**,  
transforming your local device into a **powerful hub** for AI-driven productivity and automation.

Built as a local web application with **Flet**,  
it provides a seamless chat interface to interact with a sophisticated AI,  
execute system commands, and manage the conversation history ‚Äî all within your private environment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Available commands

These are the current commands that you can use to engage with the AI Assistant.

- : 

  Start your message with : to execute a bash command 
  (e.g ":ls", ":mkdir folder", ":nmap ip")

- -r

  Start your message with -r to enable recursive chat. 
  The bot will enter a loop passing its output as a next input in order to answer 
  your task. It will automatically stop whenever it thinks the task is answered.
  (e.g "-rWrite numbers from 1 to 5. You can write one number per message")

- -:r

  Start your message with -:r to enable recursive commands. 
  The bot will enter a loop executing bash commands and using the command output as 
  input for his successive command(s). It will automatically stop whenever it thinks 
  the task is completed.
  NB: In this case you can even use general language to make it create and execute
  commands for you!
  (e.g "-:rStep1: check my ip. Step2: ping my ip. Execute one step per message")

- -f

  Start your message with -f for file creation.
  The bot will process and create a file with the format you asked 
  (for now only .py and .txt works, but you can add whatever file you want)
